                <h3>
                    Development of the first game
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first game in the series was released in 1992 on the Gameboy system by the name of Kirby's Dreamland. This game differed from the later 
                    entries, not just because of the gameplay mechanics, but also the art. It's no secret that the Gameboy didn't have colour in its games originally,
                    so the art for the game depicted Kirby as a colourless version of himself. Another thing Kirby lacked was the ability to use copy the abilities of 
                    his enemies. The Copy Abilities made their appearance later on in Kirby's Adventure, but he could still inhale things. This game was also the debut
                    of one of the other recurring characters in the series, King Dedede, who served as the main villain in this game after stealing all the food in Dreamland.

                <h3 style="clear: left;">Kirby's Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    Kirby's design originated from a placeholder sprite that Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby's creator and the person responsible for the Super Smash Bros games,
                    was using for a game he was working on back when he was in HAL Laboratory, which was going to be called 'Twinkle Popo'. Sakurai liked the placeholder
                    sprite enough that he decided to have the placeholder take the role of the protagonist in the game. The placeholder was initially named Popopo, but
                    the name was later changed. There was a list of names that was given for the new name and Kirby was chosen. According to Nintendo's Senior Managing
                    Director at the time, Shigeru Miyamoto, Kirby was also named partially after a lawyer named John Kirby who helped Nintendo when Universal Studios filed
                    a lawsuit over the existence of Donkey Kong. The name Popopo would still be referenced, however, in one of the later titles in the series by a location
                    called the Popopo Islands. As for Kirby's colours when the game came to platforms with the ability to display multiple colours, Sakurai intended for Kirby 
                    to be pink, while Miyamoto wanted Kirby to be yellow. Evidently, Sakurai's idea came to fruition, but Miyamoto's wishes were not fully ignored as Kirby
                    defaults to yellow whenever a second player can play as a second Kirby. The yellow Kirby design is usually nicknamed Keeby.

                <h3>Later Games and Recurring Themes</h3>
                <p>
                    The first appearance of Kirby's ability to inhale enemies to take their abilities was in the 1993 Kirby's Adventure on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES),
                    which was the start of the infamous theme of Kirby games having some more sinister designs for its villains as the final boss, Nightmare, had a design that
                    contrasted with the design of the other characters' more cutesy designs. This was also the beginning of the series' recurring practice of giving the player
                    an ability that is used exclusively for the final battle as Kirby's Adventure gave Kirby the Star Rod, which was used to defeat Nightmare. Kirby's Dreamland 2
                    introduced Animal Friends, who helped Kirby throughout the game, but they were not used as a gameplay concept past Kirby's Dreamland 3. Kirby Super Star had the
                    idea of adding minigames to go along with a story mode, which is a common thing in most modern Kirby games, and it introduced multiplayer in the series. One other
                    recurring idea in the series is 3D graphics, which was first done in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards.

                <p>
                    Below is a list of random facts about the series that are also tied to the history of the series. Did you know...
                </p>

                        <p>
                            That the art for many of the games when localized by Nintendo of America makes Kirby look angrier than he does
                            in the original Japanese box art? With many of the Kirby games, the Japanese box art usually has a big smile and
                            round eyes without eyebrows, while the box art from the USA gives Kirby sharper eyes with a distinctively angry face.
                            However, in Kirby Triple Deluxe and Kirby Planet Robobot, both the American and Japanese releases have an angry Kirby
                            on the box art.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That Sakurai and Kirby game director Shinya Kumazaki both voiced King Dedede throughout the series? Sakurai voiced King
                            Dedede in Kirby 64 and the Super Smash Bros series, while Kumazaki voiced Dedede in most of the Kirby games with voice work.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            That in many games, there is a hidden 'HAL' in at least one place in the game? HAL Laboratory references themselves in gameplay in many
                            of the games, from dedicated rooms with Star Blocks spelling HAL to subtle details like floor tiles spelling out HAL. Additionally,
                            the ones that have dedicated rooms usually have an enemy with a broom sweeping the L. The rooms are always found in games directed by
                            Kumazaki.
