                    This page will detail some of the history behind the development of the Kirby series, from its first game to some parts of the present day.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Development of the first game
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first game in the series was released in 1992 on the Gameboy system by the name of Kirby's Dreamland. This game differed from the later 
                    entries, not just because of the gameplay mechanics, but also the art. It's no secret that the Gameboy didn't have colour in its games originally,
                    so the art for the game depicted Kirby as a colourless version of himself. Another thing Kirby lacked was the ability to use copy the abilities of 
                    his enemies. The Copy Abilities made their appearance later on in Kirby's Adventure, but he could still inhale things.
