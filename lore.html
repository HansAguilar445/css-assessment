               </h3>
               <p>
                   This page will detail some of the lore behind the events of the Kirby series. The Kirby series has some interesting stories in the pause screens and the dialogue, despite its looks.
                   This page will cover the Ancients, a possible origin story for Kirby himself, and many other things. This page contains many spoilers for the series, so if you want to play the games
                   and find the lore yourself, please leave as this page dives deeply into spoiler territory.
               </p>
               
               <h3>
                   The Ancients
               </h3>
               <p>
                   The Ancients are probably one of the most important beings in the series, as their creations are alluded to by many of the villains, though the validity of what they say is ambiguous.
                   In Kirby's Return to Dreamland, Magolor, a magician from another dimension, told Kirby that the Ancients were responsible for the creation of his ship, the Lor Starcutter, and that they
                   created 'clockwork stars that soared the cosmos' and 'mysterious items that can bring dreams to life'. While the last one in the list is unknown, the 'clockwork stars' did appear in the
                   series in Kirby Super Star's Milky Way Wishes mode and Kirby Planet Robobot's main story as Galactic Nova and the Access Ark, respectively. The Ancients also created a sentient computer 
                   known as Star Dream. Another source of information on the Ancients is Hyness from Kirby Star Allies. According to Hyness, the Ancients were split into scientists and mages. The mages, who
                   Hyness was descended from, were extremely powerful, which helped when they needed to seal away a dark god known as Void Termina inside a container known as the Jamba Heart. The scientists feared the
                   mages for their power and cast them away, even trying to erase the existence of the mages from history. However, Hyness was insane when he brought this all up, so this anecdote might be
                   unreliable. It might not be inaccurate though, as Galacta Knight, a powerful warrior that was sealed away according to Galactic Nova due to his might, may have also had a hand in sealing away
                   Void Termina, as one of his attacks in Super Kirby Clash involves one of the tools used to seal Void Termina, a Heart Spear.

               <h3>Dark Matter, Zero, and 0<sup>2</sup></h3>
               <p>
                   Dark Matter is another important being in the series, along with Zero and 0<sup>2</sup>. In Kirby's Dreamland 2 and 3, Dark Matter is responsible for some of the troubles that plagued Dreamland,
                   possessing multiple people in Kirby's Dreamland 2 and using a Dark Matter cloud in Kirby's Dreamland 3 to try to control Planet Popstar, the location for most of the series' games. While this seems
                   insignificant in comparison to the Ancients, it's what Dark Matter is connected to that is more important. For example, in Kirby's Dreamland 3, the second player character, Gooey, is made of Dark Matter.
                   Some more questionable examples are the Master Crown from Kirby's Return to Dreamland and Void Termina in Kirby Star Allies. The biggest examples are Zero and 0<sup>2</sup>, who command forms of Dark 
                   Matter as regular Dark Matter and Miracle Matter, respectively. 
               </p> 
               <h3 style="clear: left;">Kirby's Potential Origins In-Universe</h3>
               <p>
                   There are many potential origin stories for Kirby himself within the series. For one example, Kirby is just one of a bigger species that we can only call 'Kirbies' due to a lack of a proper name. This is
                   partially supported by Meta Knight, who bears a large physical resemblance to a Kirby with a darker colour scheme, especially without the mask. Another potential connection is to Void Termina in Kirby Star
                   Allies as the pause screens for other forms of Void Termina imply that Kirby and Void Termina might be of the same origin. Whether or not the existence of the species invalidates the Void Termina possibility 
                   is unknown as of now.

                   There are more topics in the Kirby series' lore that are interesting but not important enough to receive their own sections on this page. Below are some lesser topics that have some significance to the lore of
                   the Kirby series but are less important than the ones with their own dedicated sections.
                   <ul style="padding-left: 7%;">
                       <li>
                           <p><span class="minor-categories">The Dimension Mirror and the Mirror World</span></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        One recurring item in the Kirby series is a magic mirror called the Dimension Mirror. As the name implies, the mirror is also a 'gateway' to a mirror world. It first appears in Kirby and the
                                        Amazing Mirror, where a being that could be connected to Dark Matter known as Dark Mind corrupted the mirror to only create evil reflections. Meta Knight knew this and tried to stop Dark Mind
                                        as Dark Mind's plot could endanger Dreamland, but he was stopped by an evil version of himself from the mirror called Dark Meta Knight. Kirby also got involved, though Dark Meta Knight thought
                                        it was a good idea to try to cut Kirby up. That only gave Kirby 3 clones to help him resolve the issue and Kirby entered the Mirror World. Within the Mirror World, Kirby also met his counterpart,
                                        Shadow Kirby, who he fought with due to misunderstandings. The Dimension Mirror also caused trouble in Kirby Triple Deluxe, where a spider-like character named Taranza stole the mirror and gave
                                        it to Queen Sectonia, ruler of a land in the sky called Floralia and Taranza's best friend. Sectonia loved the mirror, but each time she gazed into it, it corrupted her more and more until she
                                        became a tyrant.

                                   <p>
                                       Another Dimension is a recurring location within the series, with its first appearance being in Kirby's Return to Dreamland. There, it was a link between Planet Popstar (where Dreamland is located) 
                                       and Halcandra (Magolor's planet), not to mention the Doomer fights for Energy Spheres. However, it had more narrative significance in Kirby Planet Robobot and Kirby Star Allies. In Planet Robobot, 
                                       the reason for the villain's actions stem from an incident with the activation of Star Dream by the Haltmann Works Company. The CEO, President Max Profitt Haltmann, decided to activate Star Dream to
                                       try to use a Space-Time Transport Program that Star Dream had as a test, but the test failed and sent President Haltmann's daughter, Suzie, to Another Dimension. Thinking Suzie had died, President Haltmann
                                       dedicated himself to completing Star Dream so he could see Suzie again. Unfortunately, Star Dream's incompleteness and President Haltmann's overuse of it started erasing his memories of Suzie until,
                                       when Suzie returned from Another Dimension as an adult, President Haltmann couldn't remember who she was. In Kirby Star Allies, Hyness' prayers after Void Termina's defeat opened portals to Another Dimension,
                                       where the Heart Spears that sealed Void Termina ended up. A new Jamba Heart was forming and Kirby's team needed to pierce it with the spears to ensure that Void Termina wouldn't return.
