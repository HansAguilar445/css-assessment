                    Welcome
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Purpose of the Website
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a website about the Kirby series, specifically about its history and lore. 
                    The Kirby series, despite its looks as just a cute and friendly series, has some 
                    surprisingly dark and deep lore within its pause menus. From the existence of the Ancients
                    who were responsible for many of the threats within the series to things like the Clockwork Stars
                    such as Galactic Nova from Kirby Super Star's Milky Way Wishes mode and Star Dream from Kirby Planet Robobot,
                    the Kirby series has far more interesting lore than you would think from looking at it. 
                    This website will cover these things as well as the history of the series in its development. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Other Things
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Besides the Kirby history and lore, there is further content related to Kirby that will be covered here
                    like challenge videos and videos also covering the lore of the series.
                </p>
